## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot about linear gradients and how to use them.

### Continued development

I would like to focus on my project setup for future projects. Regular css is ok for small projects like this one, but I will use SASS for larger HTML/CSS projects.
